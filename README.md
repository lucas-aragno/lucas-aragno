# Hello there
<p alight="left">
  Hello there! I'm Lucas Aragno a software developer with approximated knowledge to many things.
  here are some bullet points of my profile since this has become sort of a resume now i guess:
  
  - I'm currently based in [Argentina](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/386113-he-dabbed-at-his-tuxedo-with-a-damp-rag-and)
  
  - Been working on Software (professionally) since 2010 on different types of programs and applications, from desktop Java apps, Blackberry apps (remember those?) to cutting edge web technologies, IOT, Machine learning and all the other buzzwords.

  - I've been a speaker at different software events (RubyConf BR, Erlang/Elixir Factory lite BA, Node Summit, JSConf Colombia and several meetups).

  - Every now and then I make open source modules and templates.

  - Developed several games, mostly during global [game jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) events but none of them are too good.

  - I'd rather talk about books and [comics](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2020/53265228) than software most of the time though

  - Kaizen Philosophy.
