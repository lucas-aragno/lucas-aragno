# Hello there
<p alight="left">
  Hello there! I'm Lucas Aragno a software developer with approximated knowledge to many things.
  here are some bullet points of my profile since this is sort of a resume i guess: 
  
  - Been working on Software (professionally) since 2010 on different types of programs and applications, from desktop Java apps, Blackberry apps (remember those?) to cutting edge     web technologies, IOT, Machine learning and all those buzzwords.

  - I've also been a speaker at different software events (RubyConf BR, Erlang/Elixir Factory lite BA, Node Summit, JSConf Colombia and several meetups) Also I tried to create some   useful open source modules and templates that you can find here.

  - Worked on as a developer several games, mostly during global [game jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) events but none of them are too good.

  - I'd rather talk about books and [comics](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2020/53265228) than software most of the time though.
